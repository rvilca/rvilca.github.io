# Renato Vilca Valderrama


### _About Me_
Hi! My name is Renato. I'm an Electrical Engineering student at The City College of New York and I'm currently in my senior year.


### _Current Projects_
**Spreadro:** For the 2021 MakeMIT Hardware Hackathon, I collaborated with a team of three to design an automated seeding and ice-melt rover. Prototype was awarded prizes in the ”Sustainability” and ”Best Home Robot” categories. [**<font color="#0088cc">Here</font>**](https://devpost.com/software/spreadro-6zds3h) is a link to the Devpost for the project. (Spring, 2021)

**HLA CX-6 Rocket:** As part of the Harlem Launch Alliance, a student-run rocketry organization, I am continuously cooperatively designing the CX – 6 rocket’s electrical recovery system and assisting in its integration into the airframe. I also oversee the electrical section’s competition compliance and am helping develop solutions to the design constraints imposed by the CX - 6 Rocket Technical Specifications. (Spring, 2020)

**N95 Mask Attachment:** For the AECOM & CCNY MTM COVID-19 Design Challenge, I worked with a team of five to design an N95 mask attachment that reduces contamination. Currently using awarded competition funding for further prototyping and to submit a provisional patent. [**<font color="#0088cc">Here</font>**](https://magazine.einsteinmed.org/winter-spring-2021/covid-19-design-challenge/) is an article featuring our project for Einstein Magazine. (Summer, 2020)


### _Past Projects_
**Microfluidic Bioprinter:** As our capstone project, a group of classmates and I created a bioprinter capable of printing microfluidic structures out of hydrogel. We modified a 3D-printer to use a 3D-printed pump and an adjustable laser to extrude and cure material into the desired shape with modified G-Code. [**<font color="#0088cc">Here</font>**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Epyl-JbAuazsyi1KYLsbCe1Hw7M5-vxs/view?usp=sharing) is how it looks like and here are [**<font color="#0088cc">1</font>**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LBCEwrquefB5wGFgmTpdwaUNZDDDOoLF/view?usp=sharing) and [**<font color="#0088cc">2</font>**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c0mySPpuiQWCkew_qt6AYFwG7hqNV5WB/view?usp=sharing) videos of it in action.(Spring, 2021)

**Scorpion Rocket:** For a Level 1 HPR Certification, I built a single-deploy Scorpion model rocket kit (courtesy of the good folks at Mac Performance Rocketry). Launched in late May at the Pine Island site of the METRA Rocket Club along with other members of the Harlem Launch Alliance. [**<font color="#0088cc">Here</font>**](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tHESJTchVMv2EkLe9) are photos of the build and launch process and [**<font color="#0088cc">here</font>**](https://photos.app.goo.gl/YDf2VZbPxbEEUUVC6) is a video of that launch. (Spring, 2021)

[**<font color="#0088cc">Arduino Controlled Fan:</font>**](https://github.com/rvilca/Arduino-Controlled-Fan) I created an Arduino controlled fan whose speed can be either controlled by a potentiometer or by the current temperature. A remote control is used to switch between the two modes. A LCD screen shows the temperature being read in Fahrenheit and what mode the fan is currently in. [**<font color="#0088cc">Here</font>**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvilca/Arduino-Controlled-Fan/main/Edit%205%20459%20with%20newest%20code.png) is how it looks like and here are [**<font color="#0088cc">1</font>**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gk494CJtEBQObdrArnRuGBvn9tSPHHUs/view?usp=sharing) and [**<font color="#0088cc">2</font>**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i_PO3feknaX6hNtdP3vwDD8R1s_I9jNk/view?usp=sharing) videos of it in action. [**<font color="#0088cc">Here</font>**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WH_MV_sWeM89hG3IIGQj6spmC00l_MNr5ah9GDILRXQ/edit?usp=sharing) is a slideshow presentation with some background on the project. (Fall, 2020)

**6-Node Network Design:** To compare routing algorithms, I used the Riverbed Modeler software to simulate a 6-node network and compare average delay, utilization, and speed of convergence. My results favored the Routing Information Protocol. [**<font color="#0088cc">Here</font>**](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/rvilca/Non-Coding-Projects/raw/main/6-Node%20Network%20Design/Renato%20Vilca%20Valderrama%20EE460%20Project.pdf&embedded=true) is a report detailing the entire project. (Spring, 2020)

**Audio Amplifier:** To create a PA amplifier, a classmate and I assembled and combined a common emitter amplifier and a push-pull power amplifier using integrated circuits on a protoboard. I tested the final product using inputs from a function generator and then a microphone. (Spring, 2019)
