## Bio
Hi! My name is Renato. I'm an Electrical Engineering student at The City College of New York and I'm currently in my senior year.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rvilca/rvilca.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Current Projects

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Past Projects
[Arduino Controlled Fan:](https://github.com/rvilca/Arduino-Controlled-Fan) I created an Arduino controlled fan whose speed can be either controlled by a potentiometer or by the current temperature. A remote control is used to switch between the two modes. A LCD screen shows the temperature being read in Fahrenheit and what mode the fan is currently in. Click the link for code, images, videos, and .BRD file.



Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rvilca/rvilca.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
