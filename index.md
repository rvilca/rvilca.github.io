# Renato Vilca Valderrama


### _About Me_
Hi! My name is Renato. I'm an Electrical Engineering student at The City College of New York and I'm currently in my senior year.


### _Current Projects_
Microfluidic Bioprinter: As our capstone project, a group of classmates and I are creating a bioprinter capable of printing microfluidic structures out of hydrogel. We are currently modifying a 3D-printer to use a piezo-electric pump, solenoid valve, and an adjustable laser to extrude and cure material into the desired shape with modified G-Code. (Spring, 2021)

MakeMIT Hardware Hackathon Spreadro: Collaborated with a team of three to design an automated seeding and ice-melt rover. Prototype was awarded prizes in the ”Sustainability” and ”Best Home Robot” categories. (Spring, 2021)

Scorpion Rocket: For Level 1 Certification, I am currently building a single-deploy Scorpion model rocket kit. Planning to fly in early May.

HLA CX-6 Rocket: As part of the Harlem Launch Alliance, a student-run rocketry organization, I am currently cooperatively designing the CX – 6 rocket’s electrical recovery system and assisting in its integration into the airframe. I also oversee the electrical section’s competition compliance and am helping develop solutions to the design constraints imposed by the CX - 6 Rocket Technical Specifications. (Spring, 2020)

AECOM & CCNY MTM COVID-19 Design Challenge Mask Attachment: Worked with a team of five to design an N95 mask attachment that reduces contamination. Currently using awarded competition funding for further prototyping and to submit a provisional patent. (Summer, 2020)


### _Past Projects_
[**<font color="#0088cc">Arduino Controlled Fan:</font>**](https://github.com/rvilca/Arduino-Controlled-Fan) I created an Arduino controlled fan whose speed can be either controlled by a potentiometer or by the current temperature. A remote control is used to switch between the two modes. A LCD screen shows the temperature being read in Fahrenheit and what mode the fan is currently in. [**<font color="#0088cc">Here</font>**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvilca/Arduino-Controlled-Fan/main/Edit%205%20459%20with%20newest%20code.png) is how it looks like and here are [**<font color="#0088cc">1</font>**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gk494CJtEBQObdrArnRuGBvn9tSPHHUs/view?usp=sharing) and [**<font color="#0088cc">2</font>**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i_PO3feknaX6hNtdP3vwDD8R1s_I9jNk/view?usp=sharing) videos of it in action. [**<font color="#0088cc">Here</font>**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WH_MV_sWeM89hG3IIGQj6spmC00l_MNr5ah9GDILRXQ/edit?usp=sharing) is a slideshow presentation with some background on the project. (Fall, 2020)

6-Node Network Design: To compare routing algorithms, I used the Riverbed Modeler software to simulate a 6-node network and compare average delay, utilization, and speed of convergence. My results favored the Routing Information Protocol. (Spring, 2020)

Audio Amplifier: To create a PA amplifier, a classmate and I assembled and combined a common emitter amplifier and a push-pull power amplifier using integrated circuits on a protoboard. I tested the final product using inputs from a function generator and then a microphone. (Spring, 2019)
