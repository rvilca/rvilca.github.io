### Past Projects
<font color="red">[**Arduino Controlled Fan:**](https://github.com/rvilca/Arduino-Controlled-Fan)</font> I created an Arduino controlled fan whose speed can be either controlled by a potentiometer or by the current temperature. A remote control is used to switch between the two modes. A LCD screen shows the temperature being read in Fahrenheit and what mode the fan is currently in. [**Here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvilca/Arduino-Controlled-Fan/main/Edit%205%20459%20with%20newest%20code.png) is how it looks like and here are [**1**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gk494CJtEBQObdrArnRuGBvn9tSPHHUs/view?usp=sharing) and [**2**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i_PO3feknaX6hNtdP3vwDD8R1s_I9jNk/view?usp=sharing) videos of it in action.
